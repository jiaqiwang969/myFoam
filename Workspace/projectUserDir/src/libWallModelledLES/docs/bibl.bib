@article{Zhang2021,
abstract = {In this work, we propose a single formula for the law of the wall, which is dubbed as the logarithmic-exponential (LOG-EXP) formula, for predicting the mean velocity profile in different regions near the wall. And then a feedforward neural network (FNN), whose inputs and training data are based on this new formula, is trained for the wall-modelled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) of turbulent channel flows. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of turbulent channel flows is used to evaluate the performance of both the formula and the FNN. Compared with the Werner-Wengle (WW) model for the WMLES, a better performance of the FNN for the WMLES is observed for predicting the Reynolds stresses.},
